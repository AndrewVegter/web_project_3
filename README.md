# Web Project 3
## From Homeland to Homeland

This project was made so that all visitors can learn a thing or two about the places Practicum contributors are from, also to help me learn to make scalable/flexible webpages.

### This webpage was made using
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Flexbox, grid, and various images.

### Changes made
  * None yet but I'm sure there will be a lot once it gets reviewed!

### Possible changes
  * Adjusting various margins, and maybe fixing some of the clunkiness in scaling
